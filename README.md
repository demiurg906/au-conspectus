# au-conspectus

This repository used to be a storage of all notes written by [@xamgore](https://github.com/xamgore), [@demiurg906](https://github.com/demiurg906) and [@AlexandraOlegovna](https://github.com/AlexandraOlegovna). We are students of the Saint Petersburg Academic University, whose courses records were kept here.

In order to synchronize our work and simplify the verification and publication, we decided to write a pipeline that would generate a site with materials. We tried to make it so that our classmates could easily report errors or make changes there. We also made a telegram bot, which notifies that a new lecture was added to the site.

After the first release, we have decided that everyone in our group wants his/her own notes, in a sense of distributed notes. To do this, @demiurg906 made a new repository **[conspectus-framework](https://github.com/demiurg906/conspectus-framework)** which is the core of all notes-repos. So every dude can add the core as a git submodule, set configuration files, and enjoy his/her own notes.

This repo is obsolete, the futher development is carried out in the [conspectus-framework](https://github.com/demiurg906/conspectus-framework) repository.
